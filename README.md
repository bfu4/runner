# runner
Somehow, I cannot figure out any distribution of Visual Studio (code as well). The only reason I'd ever use it
is if I felt like I wanted to use a text-editor with a mouse. In that occasion, I'd probably only use it in something
I use with Makefile. I also don't like the built-in C/C++ ANYTHING in VS(C). To make VSC usable and allow me to skip out
on Visual Studio, I made a really, terrible, VSC extension allowing me to hotkey running "make" and executing a binary of choice.

Made with <3.
